# Sound Healing App - Quick Start Guide

## âœ… What's Ready

1. âœ… Database schema loaded in Supabase
2. âœ… Environment variables configured (`.env`)
3. âœ… Frequency data (18 frequencies)
4. âœ… Supabase client configured
5. âœ… EmailJS service ready
6. âœ… Frequency analyzer algorithm
7. âœ… Project structure created

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

### Option 1: Convert HTML Mockup to React (Fastest)

The HTML mockup (`sound-healing-app.html`) is fully functional. I recommend:

1. **Copy the working HTML into React App.jsx**
2. **Convert to JSX syntax** (className, onClick, etc.)
3. **Extract into components** later if needed

This approach gets you live FAST, then you can refactor.

### Option 2: I Build All Components (More Time)

I can build proper React components, but it will take several more iterations due to file size.

## ðŸŽ¯ Recommended: Quick Deploy

**Let's get you live in 10 minutes:**

1. Open `sound-healing-app.html` in your browser
2. Test the full flow (it works!)
3. Copy HTML structure to React
4. Add Supabase save on form submit
5. Deploy to Netlify

Would you like me to:
- **A)** Create a single App.jsx file with everything (quickest)
- **B)** Build proper component architecture (cleaner, takes longer)
- **C)** Just give you the working HTML and deployment instructions

What's your priority: **Speed** or **Clean Code**?
